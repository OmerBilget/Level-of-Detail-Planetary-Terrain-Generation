# Level-of-Detail-Planetary-Terrain-Generation
Seamless parallel dynamic planetary terrain generation on runtime using cubemap heightmap texture for Unity with Unity Jobs System


 with unity jobs system generation is parallelized  
 I provide an example cubemap  
 only red channed needed for heightmap  
 customizable resolution and distance parameters  
 no garbage produced  
 seams that generated with heightmap resolution differences stitched  
 I used fixed sixe arrays so vertice fixed size should change accordingly to the resolution  
 collision mesh added so you can land on planet
